# RustMicroservice
running through the example to build a microservice found here http://www.goldsborough.me/rust/web/tutorial/2018/01/20/17-01-11-writing_a_microservice_in_rust/
Using this tutorial to get a better understanding of writing microservices in Rust
Hoping to add some of my own code to this project, but unless otherwise specified assume the code is from the example.

# Update
One of the dependencies maud has changed, I unfortunatly have not figured out how to fix this yet. I have learned a lot while working through this, but working through this has shown me that I still have much to learn.
